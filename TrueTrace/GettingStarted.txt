Hello and thank you for trying out my path tracer!
For more in depth/full details, go to the Readme on the Truetrace Github(at least until I can get some half decent tutorial videos made): https://github.com/Pjbomb2/TrueTrace-Unity-Pathtracer


To get started:
1. First, import the unity package.  After doing this you will need to restart unity this one time, so that the bindless plugin initialized properly.
2. After restarting, for a new scene you want to open the PathTracer tab on the top bar, and click "Arrange Hierarchy"
3. After doing this, your scene should now be in the format required by the path tracer
4. Now you can click "Build Aggregated BVH" to build the acceleration structure for all objects, and just wait for the "Remaining Objects" to turn green before entering play mode(this can be ignored if wanted)
5. After that is done, you can just enter play mode and play as normal


Adding new objects
	Automatic methods
  			Global setup: Press "Auto Assign Scripts" in the TrueTrace settings menu -> Main Options.
  			Local setup: Go to "Hierarchy Options" in the TrueTrace settings menu. 
  			Drag the root gameobject that you added to the "Selective Auto Assign Scripts" section.
  			Click "Selective Auto Assign".

	Manual method
  		Each gameobject that contains a mesh needs the script "RayTracingObject" added to it.
  		For non-skinned meshes: 
    		Add the script "ParentObject" to either:
      			Each gameobject that has a "RayTracingObject" script
      			OR
      			The Direct Parent gameobject of gameobjects that have a "RayTracingObject" script(Groups their meshes together, increasing performance)
  		For Skinned Meshes:
			Any parent gameobject of the RayTracingObjects(will group together all Skinned Children)
	For default unity lights, you just add the "RayTracingLight" script to each one

General Use/Notes
	DX12 is recommended, as it enables use of OIDN, Bindless texturing, RT Cores, and slightly higher performance
	The camera you want to render from, you attach the RenderHandler script to(if you have a camera tagged MainCamera, this will be done automatically)
