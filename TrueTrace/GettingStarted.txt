Hello and thank you for trying out my path tracer!
For more in depth/full details, go to the Readme on the Truetrace Github(at least until I can get some half decent tutorial videos made): https://github.com/Pjbomb2/TrueTrace-Unity-Pathtracer


To get started:
1. After importing the unity package, for a new scene you want to open the PathTracer tab on the top bar, and click "Arrange Hierarchy"
2. After doing this, your scene should now be in the format required by the path tracer
3. Now you can click "Build Aggregated BVH" to build the acceleration structure for all objects, and just wait for the "All Objects Built" to turn green before entering play mode
4. After that is done, you can just enter play mode and play as normal


Adding new objects
	Automatic methods
  		First, add your gameobjects as a child of the "Scene" gameobject created by TrueTrace.
  			Global setup: Press "Auto Assign Scripts" in the TrueTrace settings menu.
  			Local setup: Go to "Hierarchy Options" in the TrueTrace settings menu. 
  			Drag the root gameobject that you added to the "Selective Auto Assign Scripts" section.
  			Click "Selective Auto Assign".

	Manual method
		First, add your gameobjects as a child of the "Scene" gameobject created by TrueTrace.
  		Each gameobject that contains a mesh needs the script "RayTracingObject" added to it.
  		For non-skinned meshes: 
    		Add the script "ParentObject" to either:
      			Each gameobject that has a "RayTracingObject" script
      			OR
      			The Direct Parent gameobject of gameobjects that have a "RayTracingObject" script(Groups their meshes together, increasing performance)
  		For Skinned Meshes:
			Any parent gameobject of the RayTracingObjects(will group together all Skinned Children)
	For default unity lights, you just add the "RayTracingLight" script to each one

General Use/Notes
	DX12 is recommended, as it enables use of OIDN, Bindless texturing, RT Cores, and slightly higher performance
	The camera you want to render from, you attach the RenderHandler script to(if you have a camera tagged MainCamera, this will be done automatically)


Changeable Defines:
To access the in script settings, go to the "GlobalDefines.cginc" under the TrueTrace/Resources folder
This will allow you to toggle some low level settings:
	1. AdvancedAlphaMapping - Enables or Disables the support of cutout objects(performance penalty)
	2. ExtraSampleValidation - Shoots an additional ray(2 instead of 1) in ReSTIR GI ray validation for sharper shadows
	3. IgnoreGlassShadow - Shadow Rays can pass through glass
	4. IgnoreGlassMain - Main Rays can pass through glass
	5. FadeMapping - Enables experimental Fade material type
	6. HardwareRT - Turn on if your in Unity 2023 or higher and want to use Hardware RT cores
	7. PointFiltering - Switch between point and linear filtering for albedo textures
	8. StainedGlassShadows - Shadow rays passing through glass will be tinted to the glass color
	9. IgnoreBackFacing - Culls backfacing triangles
	10. WhiteLights - Forces all lights to be white
	11. LBVH - Enable/Disable the light BVH
	12. FasterLightSampling - Uses an alternative method for calculating LBVH PDF that is a bit wrong, but much faster
	13. AccurateEmissionTex - Turn on/off emission textures
	14. RadianceCache - Turn on/off the Radiance Cache
	15. IndirectRetraceWeighting - Adds indirect lighting into ReSTIR GI retracing/luminance validation
	16. TrueBlack - Allows materials to be truely black, removes the bottom limit
	17. AdvancedRadCacheAlt - Experimental working set for the Radiance Cache, not recomended
	18. UseTextureLOD - (Only works with Bindless)Enables Texture LOD
	19. DebugView - Replace that "DVNone" with any of the defines below, from "DVNone" to "DVGIView"
